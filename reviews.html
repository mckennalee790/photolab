            <p class="rev">McKenna is the best photographer in the whole world! So easy to work with
            and basically a genius. Very humble too. <br> Jane Doe</p>
            <br>
            <p class="rev right">Even though she specializes in nature photography, she did a phenomenal 
            job with our family photos. She was great to work with, and knew the 
            prettiest locations to take pictures. <br> Jane Smith</p>
            <br>
            <p class="rev">My 18 year old daughter decided she is going to get married to some
            guy she just barely met two months ago. They are getting married in one month
            so we have been rushing to get all the planning done and announcements out.
            We contacted McKenna trying to get last minute engagement pictures and she fit us 
            in her very busy schedule. The pictures were beautiful and she made a 
            stressful experience very easy. <br> Jane Hansen</p>
            <br>
            <p class="rev right">My wife and I bought some beautiful nature pictures of where we got 
            married and where I proposed. The pictures turned out fantastic and 
            were such a fun memory. <br> John Doe</p>
